== HotRuby

HotRuby is Ruby on JavaScript and Flash.

HotRuby runs opcode, compiled by YARV(Yet Another Ruby VM) on Ruby. To be precise, HotRuby is a Ruby VM on JavaScript and Flash.

Most of the grammars are implemented. However, exceptions are not implemented. Most of the built-in functions and built-in classes are not implemented.


== News

Now using Ruby 1.9.1, but broke some things migrating over.

Works with jQuery!


== Mission Statement:

To provide a JavaScript VM for the Ruby language to support legacy browsers. 

Legacy browsers don't handle &lt;script language="text/ruby"&gt; tags, but they do support JavaScript.

In order for developers to be free to use Ruby as a web based scripting language they need to be certain that their code will run on as many platforms as possible.

HotRuby will enable using Ruby on all major browser platforms.


== Github?

It was developed by yukoba ?, the official website is at http://hotruby.accelart.jp/.

The original repository is at http://code.google.com/p/hotruby/, but it seems to be abandoned.

Github to the rescue!
